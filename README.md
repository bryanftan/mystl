# mystl

`mystl` is a collection of common C++ standard library constructs. I found that re-implementing the standard library is a great way to learn C++ concepts. I hope for this to an evolving project which will constantly improve together with my knowledge of C++.

## Implementations

#### 1. container
* [vector](./include/container/vector.h)

#### 2. memory
* [unique_ptr](./include/memory/unique_ptr.h)
* [shared_ptr](./include/memory/shared_ptr.h)
